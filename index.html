      Features That Needs To Be In a Habitable Planet

First of all, water is the source of life, and water is needed for life to exist on a planet. To determine wheather exoplanets have liquid water, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can be determined. The planet must have sufficient mass to hold water in its atmosphere.The volumes, masses and densities of the observed planets can be determined to understand whether they have conditions suitable for life. Then, using the radiation of the star and the distance of the planet from the star, the temperature of the planet and the possibility of liquid water on its surface can be evaluated. If the conditions are suitable, observations can be made to see if there is water in its atmosphere.
The presence of biogases in a planet's atmosphere does not necessarily mean that the planet is inhabited!

Basic Conditions For Life: liquid water, a source of usable energy (e.g. sunlight for photosynthesis), and organic (carbon-containing) chemicals. All these conditions are determined by the position of the planet in the universe. 
First of all, the position of the star system in the galaxy is important
