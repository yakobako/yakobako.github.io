      Features That Needs To Be In a Habitable Planet

First of all, water is the source of life, and water is needed for life to exist on a planet. To determine wheather exoplanets have liquid water, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere can be determined. The planet must have sufficient mass to hold water in its atmosphere.The volumes, masses and densities of the observed planets can be determined to understand whether they have conditions suitable for life. Then, using the radiation of the star and the distance of the planet from the star, the temperature of the planet and the possibility of liquid water on its surface can be evaluated. If the conditions are suitable, observations can be made to see if there is water in its atmosphere.
The presence of biogases in a planet's atmosphere does not necessarily mean that the planet is inhabited!

Basic Conditions For Life: liquid water, a source of usable energy (e.g. sunlight for photosynthesis), and organic (carbon-containing) chemicals. All these conditions are determined by the position of the planet in the universe. 
First of all, the position of the star system in the galaxy is important.

Features Of Our Planet
-The radius of the planet is 8350 kilometers and the perimeter of the planet is 52 thousand kilometers.
-The average temperature of the planet is 16.58 °C so it's colder than the earth.
-The distance between the star and the planet is 160 million kilometers. This means the planet is in the habitable zone.
-The planet is mostly covered with vegetation so there is more percent of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere.
-The axial tilt of the planet is 35° 32’ so winters are colder and summers are hotter, so it causes there to be two seasons. 
-There is 0.8x10^9 km3 of water on this planet there is less water than Earth and %55 of the water is drinkable and the %45 can be purified easily.
-Unlike on Earth, in this world, the sun rises from the west because its rotation direction is opposite to the Earth's.
-The atmosphere is 5,1x10^8 kilograms and it contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen like the Earth but on this planet oxygen percentage is higher than the Earth.
Nitrogen
%70,8
Oxygen
%27,3
Argon
%1.2
Carbon dioxide
%0,003
Water	%0-5
Other gases	%0,002
-It has two moons one of them is 1/8 of it, and one of them is 1/15 of the planet.
-One year on this planet is 450 days and one day is 20 hours which means there are 225 days of summer and 225 days of winter.
-In winter, almost all water in one hemisphere freezes at the top, in this scenario all of the plants in that hemisphere go into “hibernation”.
